\details{
The character representation of a SpotRate is as follows:

\preformatted{"RATE COMPOUNDING DAYCOUNT CALENDAR"}

where:
\itemize{
\item \code{RATE} is a numeric value
\item \code{COMPOUNDING} is one of the following:
\code{simple}, \code{discrete}, \code{continuous}
\item \code{DAYCOUNT} is a valid day count rule, pex. \code{business/252},
see \code{\link{daycount-class}}
\item \code{CALENDAR} is the name of a bizdays calendar.
}

\code{simplify} check if compounding, daycount and calendar are the same for
all given characters.
If it is true the returned object is a SpotRate otherwise a \code{list} with
SpotRate objects is returned.
