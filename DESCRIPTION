Description: fixedincome has a set of funtions which helps with the mathematics
    of interest rates and fixed income. It handles the interest rates and
    compounding factors as objects and provides many methods to tackle specific
    issues like compute discount factors, find equivalent rates, forward rates, and
    so on. It also has classes to represent commom fixed income entities such as a
    term structure of interest rates, spot rates and day count rules. This package
    also supports methods and models commom used by practitioners to do fixed income
    calculations.
